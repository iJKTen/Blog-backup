excerpt: It is important to have trust in yourself to know what you know and to remember that if you do not know something then you can learn.

Slack has many alternatives like discord, teams, glip, & flock to name a few. We have Starbucks, dunkin donuts, & Caribou Coffee to name a few. Endless project management software. But not all of them are the best for you if you are in the market for one of them. You do not compare. That is now how it works. Stop comparing. 

So if you ever feel that there are so many things I do not know, which may lead you to feel like an imposter, then stop. Write down the things you know. Remember, how you felt when you were learning those things and be proud of yourself on all the things you have learned and where you are now. 

The best way to get rid of imposter is to be humble, tell yourself, I do not know this now, but I know I can learn and I will learn.

This article is not for you but for me in case I ever feel this way... again.
