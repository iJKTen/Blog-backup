excerpt: I am working on a personal site written in ReactJS with reach-router and  @emotion/styled
---

I started work on my personal/portfolio site written in ReactJS using [@reach/router](https://reach.tech/router), and [@emotion/styled](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction). I plan to host this site on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) with couple of JSON files hosted on GitHub.

To challenge myself I will be using @emotion/styled so I can write about it later. I believe hosting on S3 will be the most cost effective because no one is going to visit the site. 

This is how the site looks like right now
![](/content/images/2020/04/image-66.png)Responsive first development. Always.
Projects "page" will list all my personal projects. I am thinking, this will be a JSON file hosted on GitHub (*I don't know yet if I am going to run into any CORS issue or not but if I do then I can host the files on S3*) so I can use hooks and create an API. 

Resume "page" will be my resume. This page will be part static and part dynamic with some content coming from a JSON file hosted on GitHub. 

Check out the [repo](https://github.com/iJKTen/ijk.me) on my GitHub.
