excerpt: I did have an iOS blog before and my hope is not repeat the same mistakes

I don't know. Seems like a good idea. I may have read an article that said why every programmer needs a blog and bought into the idea. Or may be I want to create one and see what happens. It is a good way to explore ideas, write down your thoughts. 

### My approach to this blog?

No detail is too small not write about. No overthinking. If I have something to write about, I write it. I am not focused on adding analytics or making it look pretty. That can come later. Not concerned about followers. 

My goal is to write down my thoughts and hopefully it helps someone. How will I know if it's helping someone without comments or analytics? My approach is to just do it and not think about the end result. If it is helping someone then that's good enough. 

### How do I come up with topics?

My approach is to write about the errors or warnings I encounter in my own personal projects. I plan to write about how I approach personal projects and implement them. How I understand something.

I want to remove any road blocks which will prevent me from publishing an article and if you are thinking about creating a project or starting a programming blog then some of them are

1. I don't know whtat to write about
2. I spend lots of time picking a blogging engine, theme, making it look pretty, adding analytics.
3. I cannot think of any personal projects.
4. If I create a personal project and show it the world, the world will laugh at me

1. I don't know what to call my blog. I cannot come up with a funny name
2. The editor I use to write my blog cannoot continue list numbers after I insert an image between an ordered list (ul > li) and it's bad and I want to find a new blogging engine. Every engine will have issues.
3. My English is bad. I am a programmer not a writer
4. My code is bad. I cannot write good code.
5. People on the internet critize instead of being supportive. 
6. It takes a lot of time to write a blog. *I have spend a total of less than 8 hours writing 6 artiicles including this one.*
7. I can only think of simple programming things to write about which are so basic that on one will want to read them. *So what?*
8. Honestly, I am just scared. This is not me. *This may not be you now but your future self can be different*

If you want to start something then just do it. You can figure out the details later.

Trust me, not much thinking is going on when I hit publish.
